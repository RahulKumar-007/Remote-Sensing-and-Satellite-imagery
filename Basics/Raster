A raster image, also known as a bitmap image, is a type of digital image composed of a grid of pixels. Each pixel in the grid is assigned a specific color or intensity value, forming a matrix that represents the image's visual content. Raster images are widely used in various applications, including satellite imaging, digital photography, graphic design, and geographic information systems (GIS).

In a raster image, each pixel contains information about its position within the grid and its color or grayscale value. The resolution of a raster image refers to the number of pixels per unit area, often expressed as pixels per inch (PPI) or dots per inch (DPI). Higher resolution raster images generally offer more detail and visual fidelity.

Raster images can store and display a wide range of visual data, including photographs, illustrations, maps, and scanned documents. They can represent colors using different color models, such as RGB (Red, Green, Blue) or CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black), and can have various bit depths, determining the number of bits used to represent each pixel's color or intensity value.

One important characteristic of raster images is that they are resolution-dependent. Scaling or enlarging a raster image may result in a loss of quality or pixelation if the original resolution is not sufficient. Additionally, raster images are typically larger in file size compared to vector graphics, as they store information for each individual pixel.

Raster images can be edited and manipulated using image processing software, allowing for tasks such as cropping, resizing, applying filters, adjusting colors, or enhancing details. However, due to their resolution-dependent nature, major modifications to a raster image may result in a loss of quality or introduce artifacts.

In summary, raster images are digital images composed of a grid of pixels, each with a specific color or intensity value. They are widely used for representing visual content in various domains and can be edited and manipulated using image processing software. Understanding raster images is essential when working with satellite imagery, photography, digital art, or GIS applications.
